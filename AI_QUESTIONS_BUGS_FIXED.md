# AI Questions Bugs Fixed

## Bugs Identified and Fixed

### Bug 1: Question Text Not Visible
**Issue**: The question text was not appearing in the UI, only the answer choices were visible.

**Root Cause**: When the backend sent subsequent questions (after the first one), it wasn't including all the necessary fields like `timeLimit`, `points`, `hint`, and `funFact` that the first question had.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `backend/server.js` to include all question fields when sending the next question
- Added enhanced logging in `frontend/contexts/GameRoomContext.tsx` to help debug question delivery

### Bug 2: Questions Automatically Marked as Incorrect
**Issue**: Questions 2 and 3 were being automatically marked as incorrect before the user could see the result.

**Root Cause**: In single-player mode, the backend was immediately moving to the next question after answer submission, not giving the UI enough time to show the result.

**Fix Applied**:
- Increased the delay from 3 seconds to 5 seconds before sending the next question
- This gives the UI enough time to show whether the answer was correct/incorrect

## Code Changes

### Backend (server.js)
1. Fixed next question delivery to include all fields:
```javascript
const questionForClient = {
  id: nextQuestion.id,
  questionNumber: nextQuestionNumber,
  category: nextQuestion.category,
  question: nextQuestion.question,
  choices: nextQuestion.choices,
  difficulty: nextQuestion.difficulty,
  timeLimit: nextQuestion.time_limit || 30,
  points: nextQuestion.points || 100,
  ...(nextQuestion.hint && { hint: nextQuestion.hint }),
  ...(nextQuestion.fun_fact && { funFact: nextQuestion.fun_fact })
};
```

2. Increased delay between questions from 3 to 5 seconds

### Frontend (GameRoomContext.tsx)
1. Added enhanced validation and logging for question delivery
2. Better error handling to help identify missing fields

## Testing
To verify the fixes:
1. Start a new game
2. Check that all questions display their text properly
3. After answering a question, you should see the result for ~5 seconds before the next question appears
4. Check the console logs for any error messages about missing question data
